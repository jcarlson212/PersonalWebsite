        <h2>A simple analysis of what makes certain countries have a higher GDP Per Capita</h2>
        <p>Poverty is a issue that permeates a lot of the discussions today that revolve around equity. In this post, we 
            explore what might cause some of this inequity by focusing on finding certain causes of higher GDP per capita that will be used 
            in future blog posts for more serious mathematical analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, notice that all of the countries in the top 5 of GDP per capita in 2017 (data obtained from The World Bank at 
            https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) are situated in / owned by countries traditionally regarded as wealthy
            - China (Macao), Great Brittain (Carman Islands, Isle of Man), France (Monaco), and Luxembourg. 
        </p>  
        <table class="dataTable2">
            <tr><th>Rank</th>
                <th>Country Name</th>
                <th>GDP Per Capita(2017)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Monaco</td>
                <td>167101.759</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Luxembourg</td>
                <td>107361.307</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Macao SAR, China</td>
                <td>81516.6749</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>Cayman Islands</td>
                <td>81124.5135</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Isle of Man</td>
                <td>80989.1722</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        

        <p>The following are the PPP adjusted (if possible for some) graphs of their GDP per capita (https://tradingeconomics.com/luxembourg/gdp-per-capita-ppp)</p>

        <p>(Note that Isle of Man and Luxembourg are not PPP adjusted)
            Since these countries clearly don't have data that goes back too far (mid 20th century), we will
            look at the GDP per capita of China, Great Brittain, and France:

        <img src="china-gdp-per-capita.png" alt="China GDP Per Capita" class="rounded">

        <p>We would like to find things that characterize these economies. For now, we list a few things that we will build
            upon in the future:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                France and the UK both have very similar graphs. Maybe certain growth rates in the late 20th century strongly correlate
                with European success.
            </li>
            <li>
                China has a very different graph. Notice that it runs in parallel with Macao. Perhaps Asian countries that have high GDP 
                per capita are characterized by a recent surge in growth. 
            </li>
            <li>
                How does this compare to poor countries?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does China make most of its money vs Great Brittain and France?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the United States closely tied to the European markets, the Chinese markets, or both? Or could 
                they also have some dependence on countries in the Middle East due to oil (which were not in the top 5, but
                many of which are in the top 10).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>We will explore these ideas and questions in the future. Thanks for reading!</p>
